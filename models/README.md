# Feature Propagation Module with Attention (FPMA)

In [MTINet](https://github.com/SimonVandenhende/Multi-Task-Learning-PyTorch), they proposed feature propagation module (FPM).
We introduce the concept of attention to the existing FPM and use it.

FPMA has the same structure as the existing FPM, and the non-linear function has been replaced with an attention module.
